# Task List App
## This project is currently still under construction, and is here for progress updates

## Planned Features
 This small-scale app will connect to a database in the backend, while the user will interact with the basic Java Swing GUI to utilize the app's features. Users will be able to create an account and password, and add tasks into categories, all of which will be stored in the database. There is a layer between the GUI and Database later named Application to demonstrate knowledge of the three-tiered architecture structure of database interaction.

 ## Updates will be kept track of within this README
 3/8/24 Functionality of application level mostly finished aside from a couple other features I would like to add. GUI still needs implemented</br>
 3/19/24 Implemented GUI and connected to Application layer. App is fully functional.

## Features Roadmap
