# Task List App
## Version one of the project has been pushed

## Planned Features
 This small-scale app connects to a database in the backend, while the user interacts with the basic Java Swing GUI to utilize the app's features. Users are able to create an account and password and add tasks into categories, all of which will be stored in the database. There is a layer between the GUI and Database layer named Application to demonstrate knowledge of the three-tiered architecture structure of database interaction.

 ## Updates will be kept track of within this README
 3/8/24 Functionality of application level mostly finished aside from a couple other features I would like to add. GUI still needs implemented</br>
 3/19/24 Implemented GUI and connected to Application layer. App is fully functional.

## Features Roadmap
- ~~Implement GUI~~
- Make any necessary changes of app level following implementation of the GUI
- ~~Add email function for high priority tasks~~
- Add verification of emails upon creating account
